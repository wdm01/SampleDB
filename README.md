# üïÆ Azure Bootcamp Overview & Goals
‚Æ© Gain an understanding of the full Azure DevOps lifecycle
>- Agile Planning
>- Version Control
>- Continuous Integration
>- Continuous Deployment
>- Infrastructure as Code

‚Æ© We want to do this with as few external dependencies as possible <br>
‚Æ© Discuss some of the challenges specific to Data Engineering projects  <br>
‚Æ© Talk about alternates to Azure DevOps that we might encounter  <br>

# üóê Setup

## Azure DevOps Subscription
In order to create a subscription, you need an azure account. If you don't currently have one, you will need to sign up at [portal.azure.com](portal.azure.com). If you have a Visual Studio Professional or higher subscription level, you may be able to take advantage of free subbscription credits.

- Navigate to [Dev Ops Organizations](https://aex.dev.azure.com/me?mkt=en-US).  
- Find the `Create new organization` button and create a new one. <br>
*If you are already an admin of an Organization and wish to use that, feel free to do so.*
- Create a new project
Under **Advanced**: <br> Choose **Git** as the version control and **Agile** as the template.
 *(naming doesn't matter for this walk-through)*

<br> 


## Azure Resource Manager Service Connection
- Go to your project `Setting` > `Service Connections` > `New Service Connection`
- Choose the following properties:
	- **Connection Type:** Azure Resource Manager
	- **Authentication Method:** Service Principal (automatic)
	- **Scope Level:** Subscription
	- **Resource Group:** (leave this blank)
	- **Service Connection Name:** servCon1
	- **Security:** Grant access to all pipelines


<br> 



## Initialize Source Control Repository
- This [github repo](https://github.com/wdm01/SampleDB) contains all of the files needed for this walkthrough.
- Go to `Repos` > `Files` 
Under **"Import a repository"** choose `Import` and paste the following: <br> https://github.com/wdm01/SampleDB.git in the flyout panel

<br>
We will eventually need the following variables mapped in our pipeline:

>**adminUser** = bootcamp123 <br>
**serverName** = myServerNameHere <br>
**adminPass** = TempPa$$wordOrWhateverYouWantHere <br>
**azureResourceManagerConnection** = servCon1 <br>
**subscriptionId** = [found here](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) <br>
**resourceGroupName** = whatever-you-want-rg <br>
